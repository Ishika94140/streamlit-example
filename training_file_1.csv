This article introduces a course-based undergraduate experience (CURE) combining CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing (using a modified two-plasmid system) and the animal model Caenorhabditis elegans. This CURE is designed to be a scalable, semester-long laboratory that will introduce the students to literature searches, molecular biology, experiment planning, microscopy, CRISPR bioethics discussion, and scientific writing. Here, students challenged themselves to endogenously tag the C. elegans gene zmp-4, a matrix metalloproteinase enzyme, with a fluorescent protein marker and successfully generated a new worm strain. The knock-in was confirmed with genotyping and imaging and will be available for use by the entire worm community. © 2019 Author(s).",,,,,,,"National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS: MIRA GM118049

Our objective was to identify facilitators and barriers to English language scientific writing among pharmacy students in Umm Al-Qura University in Saudi Arabia (where English is not the native language). Methods: We used face-to-face semi-structured interviews in the Arabic language with fourth- and fifth-year students of the college to gain insight into their perspectives. An interview guide was prepared using the Arabic language. The interviews were conducted at the college of pharmacy. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Results: Twenty-three participants agreed to be interviewed and signed the consent form. The mean interview time was 10 min. Two researchers independently analyzed the qualitative data using thematic analysis and agreed on the coding and themes. A third researcher verified the themes on randomly selected transcripts. The analysis showed main facilitator themes of: having rich vocabulary, competency in English language, having new ideas, increased writing activities, and individual guidance. Barrier themes were: lack of vocabulary, incompetency in English language, time constraint, lack of ideas, lack of writing activities, and lack of guidance. Conclusions: Participants of this study showed limited understanding of scientific writing. This study also found that pharmacy students need to develop their writing skills through practice sessions and university courses. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Barriers; Facilitators; Pharmacy students; Qualitative approach; Scientific writing,adult; Arabic (language); article; clinical article; controlled study; English (language); female; genetic transcription; human; human experiment; informed consent; male; pharmacy student; qualitative research; randomized controlled trial; Saudi Arabia; semi structured interview; skill; thematic analysis; vocabulary; writing,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Miedzinski, L., Davis, P., Al-Shurafa, H., Morrison, J., A Canadian faculty of medicine and dentistry's survey of career development needs (2001) Med Educ, 35 (9), pp. 890-900; Kaliyadan, F., Thalamkandathil, N., Parupalli, S., English language proficiency and academic performance: a study of a medical preparatory year program in Saudi Arabia (2015) Avicenna J Med, 5 (4), pp. 140-144; Sibahi, R., English triumphalism in academic writing: the price of global visibility (2015) Arab World Engl J, 6 (3), pp. 205-218; McClure, C., Introducing scientific writing to students early in their academic careers (2009) J Coll Sci Teach, 38 (6), pp. 20-23; Rawson, R.F., Quinlan, K.M., Cooper, B.J., Writing-skills development in the health professions (2005) Teach Learn Med, 17 (3), pp. 233-238; Brookshire, R., Brundage, S., Writing Scientific Research in Communication Sciences and Disorders (2015), 1st ed.

Four Indonesian Mendeley Advisors were interviewed online using convenient sampling technique. This study revealed that reasons for plagiarizing are time restriction, laziness, and busy. The significance of citing and referencing using Mendeley to avoid plagiarism are (1) confirm, justify, and claim the issue conveyed in scientific work; (2) highlight a particular idea; (3) criticize or approve the premise of others, and (4) build argument. Mendeley usage acquaintance for scientific writing is expected to be practical tools for avoiding plagiarism and promote academic honesty in the setting of higher education. However, the role of supervisor is crucial to provide useful feedback for their students writing to help students avoid plagiarism.

Study Design and Setting: An online survey was distributed to authors of observational studies recruited via social media, personal network snowballing, and mass mailings using targeted search strategies. Data on demographics, awareness, motivators, and usage were collected in conjunction with a modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) scale on which confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed. Results: One thousand fifteen participants completed the survey. Of these, 185 (18.2%) indicated they had never heard of STROBE nor used it previously, 195 (19.2%) had heard of it but never used it, and 635 (62.6%) had used it. Journals promoting STROBE were both key motivators and awareness mechanisms; peers and educational workshops were also important influencing factors to a lesser degree. The internal consistency of the modified UTAUT scale was strong (Cronbach's alpha = 0.94). CFA supported a four-factor model with 23 questions. Conclusion: The endorsement of STROBE by journals is key to authors awareness and use of the guideline. We tested and validated our scale which can guide future research on reporting guidelines. © 2019 The Authors",Epidemiologic research design; Guidelines as topic; Information dissemination/methods; Observational studies; Online survey; Scientific writing; STROBE,adult; article; awareness; confirmatory factor analysis; Cronbach alpha coefficient; female; human; human experiment; information dissemination; internal consistency; major clinical study; male; observational study; practice guideline; social media; writing,,,,,"Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO: MDM-2014-0445, MTM2015-64465-C2-1-R

The skills emphasized are collaboration across disciplines to creatively approach a problem, scientific writing, and the visual display of quantitative information. These skills are highly valued in industry and graduate study, yet are not always explicitly taught in a traditional undergraduate curriculum. The contest experience gives students a realistic appreciation for collaborative science work. Moreover, the active learning aspect of the preparation is broadly linked with student success in STEM, particularly for traditionally underrepresented STEM students. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Consortium of Mathematics and its Applications; Mathematical Contest in Modeling; Modeling; STEM,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

Scientific writings are also categorized as structured document because the scientific papers have parts such as title, abstract, content, and conclusion, so we are going to find important information on those parts. So the method that suitable was Associative Neural Network Algorithm and using trained Associative Neural network with chosen keywords data sets we are able to find keywords features in scientific documents. So the automated keywords extraction and pre-included keywords from the writer will be compared to choose either the most relevant or complementary and providing recommendation or perhaps the extracted automated keywords and the keywords from the writer are exactly the same. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Abstracting; Extraction; Semantics; Technical writing; Associative neural network; Keyword extraction; Keywords extraction; Scientific documents; Scientific papers; Scientific writing; Semantic relatedness; Structured document; Semantic Web,,,,,"Universitas Indonesia, UI","We would like to express sincere gratitude to Mr. Assoc.

This research method used was Jaro-Winkler Distance as method. Jaro-Winkler is a method that calculates the distance between strings and then measures the similarity. Doc2Vec (Paragraph Vector) is a method that aims to represent documents in vector form for comparison with the machine learning process. The results of this study compare the results of plagiarism detection between the Jaro-Winkler Distance method and the Doc2Vec method. The best measurement comparison method used is the accuracy of the comparison of documents and their speed. Using the dataset created, Doc2Vec outperformed the Jaro-Winkler Distance algorithm in comparing document similarities. Therefore, the development of a document similarity method will be easier in the future by using Doc2Vec (Paragraph Vector) in Indonesian scientific works. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Technical writing; Vectors; Distance algorithm; Distance method; Document similarity; Measurement comparison; Plagiarism detection; research methods; Scientific writing; Vector method; Learning systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Setiawan, E.B., Setiyadi, A., Web vulnerability analysis and implementation (2018) IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering., 407 (1), p. 012081; Pupovac, V., Fanelli, D., Scientists admitting to plagiarism: A meta-analysis of surveys (2015) Sci.

The students read, analyse and synthesise research articles using the Scientific Argumentation Model (SAM), a tool to make explicit the characteristics of the research article genre. We explored to what extent 21 students make a synthesis when writing a review of two research articles and which research articles genre characteristics (rhetorical moves and qualifiers) they use. We defined a synthesis as a task in which students select, organise, and connect the articles content. The analysis of students reviews showed that most students made a synthesis of both articles. The articles objective, supports and main conclusion were mostly reflected in the students reviews. Most students did not use a qualifier in their final conclusion, and when they did use a qualifier it sometimes did not correspond to their main text, suggesting difficulties with understanding the rhetorical meaning of qualifiers. We suggest, supported by our interview and questionnaire data, that SAM could be useful for understanding, selecting, and organising research articles content when writing a review. We conclude that the use of SAM could be a first step in synthesising research articles focused on supporting students rhetorical consciousness. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

This article offers and reviews several useful toolkit items that instructors of science writing can use to improve college student success. The tools in this kit are both conceptual and practical, and include: 1) Understanding the role of student metacognition, cognitive instruction, and strategic teaching, 2) Recognition of different student writing levels, 3) Applying the writing process, 4) Demonstrational classroom revision and editing, 5) Student-teacher sentence editing, 6) Student peer editing and guided student editing, 7) Student copy-editing, 8) Reflective writing, 9) Addressing plagiarism, paraphrasing, and proper in-text citations and referencing, and 10) Using external, on campus and online resources. Additionally, we discuss the new challenges of teaching scientific writing online versus face-to-face. The discussions, approaches, and exercises presented in this paper empower teachers in assisting students in their development of a personal writing style, while simultaneously building student confidence. The tools we present augment our previous presentation of the student writing toolkit, and can improve and enhance the teaching of scientific writing to undergraduate students. © 2018, © 2018 Royal Society of Biology.",Biological writing; class instruction; scientific writing; teaching approaches; undergraduates,,,,,,"University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, UTRGV","We continually appreciated our students at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley for the wealth of examples they provide, which help us teach biological communications and technical writing.

The role that Eugène N. Marais (1871-1936) had played to introduce this plant to science, confirms the contribution of the informed amateur in the community. It also demonstrates that Marais had exceptional observational abilities and was able to realise the value of his observations. Furthermore, it illustrates the continuous tension between functional and scientific writing, in which case one always casts a shadow over the other (or that the reader is constantly aware of one, while he or she is engaged with the other). The so-called Marais myth had been created by both himself and other people, but the story (and oral history) of the discovery of the Waterberg cycad contributes to a rectification of the myth of Marais-the-quack/charlatan/swindler and attest to his knowledgeableness. © 2019, © 2019 JLS/TLW.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Barthes, R., (1972) Mythologies, , London: Granada, (Selected and translated from the French by Annette Lavers; Botha, E., (1980) Oor die Afrikaanse prosa en ander opstelle, , Kaapstad: Tafelberg; Botha, E., (1987) Prosakroniek, , Kaapstad: Tafelberg; Cloete, T.T., (1992) Literêre terme en teorieë, , Pretoria: HAUM-Literêr, (red; Cuddon, J.A., (1977) Literary Terms and Literary Theory, , Fourth Edition, Massachusetts: Blackwell,.

Survey and interview data were collected from 55 Latin American health and life scientists and 7 North American scientific journal editors connected to an intensive scholarly writing for publication course. Study findings point to competing perceptions (scientists vs. editors) of fairness in the adjudication of Latin American scientists research at international scientific journals. Adopting a critical, plurilingual lens, I argue that these findings demand a space for more equity-driven pedagogies, policies, and reflective practices aimed at supporting the robust participation of plurilingual scientists who use English as an additional language (EAL). In particular, if equity is indeed a shared goal, there is a clear need for commitment to ongoing critical self-reflection on the part of scientific journal gatekeepers and research writing support specialists. © 2019 SAGE Publications.",English as a foreign language; English for academic purposes; English for specific purposes; multilingualism; plurilingualism; scientific knowledge production; scientific writing; second language writing,,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author received financial support for this research from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.",,,,,,,"Abdeljaoued, M., Tunisian academics at the turbulent times of the Jasmine Revolution: Publication challenges and survival strategies (2018) Publishing Research Quarterly, 34 (3), pp. 347-361; Adamson, J., Stewart, A., Smith, C., Lander, B., Fujimoto-Adamson, N., Martinez, J., Masuda, M., Exploring the publication practices of Japan-based EFL scholars through collaborative autoethnography (2019) English Scholars Beyond Borders, 5 (1), pp. 3-31; Adamson, J., Muller, T., Reviewer feedback on multilingual scholars writing for English Publication: Perspectives from the periphery (2017) Writing & Pedagogy, 8 (3), pp. 521-538; Amano, T., González-Varo, J.P., Sutherland, W.J., Languages are still a major barrier to global science (2016) PLOS Biology, 14 (12), p. e2000933; Ammon, U., (2001) The dominance of English as a language of science: Effects on other languages and language communities, , Berlin, Germany, de Gruyter, (Ed; Ammon, U., Linguistic inequality and its effects on participation in scientific discourse and on global knowledge accumulationWith a closer look at the problems of the second-rank language communities (2012) Applied Linguistics Review, 3 (2), pp. 333-355; Arnbjörnsdóttir, B., Supporting Nordic scholars who write in English for research publication purposes (2019) Pedagogies and policies on publishing research in English: Local initiatives supporting international scholars, pp. 77-90. , Corcoran J., Englander K., Muresan L., (eds), New York, NY, Routledge, (Eds.), (., -; Arnbjörnsdóttir, B., Ingvardsdóttir, H., Issues of identity and voice: Writing English for research purposes in the semiperiphery (2017) Global academic publishing: Policies, perspectives and pedagogies, pp. 73-87. , Curry M.J., Lillis T., (eds), Clevedon, UK, Multilingual Matters, (Eds.), (., -; Atkinson, D., Crusan, D., Matsuda, P.K., Ortmeier-Hooper, C., Ruecker, T., Simpson, S., Tardy, C., Clarifying the relationship between L2 writing and translingual writing: An open letter to writing studies editors and organization leaders (2015) College English, 77 (4), p. 383; Bardi, M., Muresan, L., Changing research writing practices in Romania: Perceptions and attitudes (2014) The semiperiphery of academic writing: Discourses, communities and practices, pp. 121-147. , Bennett K., (ed), Berlin, Germany, Mouton De Gruyter, (Ed.), (., -; Barton, D., Hamilton, M., Ivani?, R., (2000) Situated literacies: Reading and writing in context, , London, UK, Routledge; Belcher, D., Seeking acceptance in an English-only research world (2007) Journal of Second Language Writing, 16, pp. 1-22; Bennett, K., Introduction: The political and economic infrastructure of academic practice: The semiperiphery as a category for social and linguistic analysis (2014) The semiperiphery of academic writing, pp. 1-9. , Bennett K., (ed), London, UK, Palgrave Macmillan, (Ed.), (., -; Blommaert, J., (2010) The sociolinguistics of globalization, , Cambridge, UK, Cambridge University Press; Bocanegra-Valle, A., Peer reviewers recommendations for language improvement in research writing (2015) English as a scientific and research language: Debates and discourses, pp. 207-232. , Plo R., Pérez-Llantada C., (eds), Berlin, Germany, De Gruyter, (Eds.), (., -; Bortolis, A., Running like Alice and losing good ideas: On the quasi-compulsive use of English by non-native English speaking scientists (2012) Ambio, 41, pp. 769-772; Bourdieu, P., (1991) Language and symbolic power, , Raymond G., Adamson M., (eds), Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, (, Trans; Bourdieu, P., Passeron, J.C., Introduction: Language and relationship to language in the teaching situation (1994) Academic discourse: Linguistic misunderstanding and professorial power, pp. 1-34. , Bourdieu P., Passeron J.C., De Saint Martin M., (eds), Cambridge, UK, Polity, (Eds.), (., -; Burgess, S., Martín, P., Balasanyan, D., English for research publication purposes or Spanish for research publication purposes?

Assuring the relevance and quality of the research conducted in any research field is a crucially important task. The rapidly increasing publication rates imply that review papers will play a progressively more central role to that end. The aim of the present paper is to critically assess whether reviews dealing with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are effective vehicles for a healthy dialogue about methodological weaknesses, uncertainties, research gaps and the future direction of the field. We carried out a tiered content-analysis of CEC review papers. Relevant papers were identified through searches in Web of Science (Clarivate), leading to the identification of 6391 original research papers of which 193 are review papers. We find that the majority of CEC reviews are written as if they are comprehensive, even though this clearly is not the case. A minority (~20%) take a critical-analytical approach to the reviewing task and identify weaknesses and research gaps. The following widespread tendencies in CEC research papers are commonly noted as concerning: to equate removal of CECs to decreased concentrations in the effluent; to focus on parent substances and not concern oneself with degradation products; to focus on most commonly studied substances rather than those of most concern; to not deal with the corollary of our inability to detect or assess the risk for all substances, and to give insufficient attention to uncertainties and the unknown. Several critical-analytical reviews are among the highest cited, which suggests that they have the potential to function as effective vehicles for a healthy dialogue on these topics. On the other hand, it would appear that the concerns expressed in these reviews have a limited impact, as the same concerns are repeated over time. This might be due to a tendency among review authors to express their concerns implicitly, instead of clearly spelling them out. Our study suggests that CEC reviews presently fail to provide adequate and reliable guidance regarding the relevance and quality of research in the field. We argue that the overwhelming number of publications in combination with a lack of quality criteria for review papers are reasons to this failure: it is well documented that choices made during the reviewing process have a major impact on the outcome of a review. These choices include: search engine; the criteria used to include or exclude papers; the criteria used to assess the quality of the data generated in the research papers included; the criteria used for the choice of substances/ organisms/ technologies reported on. The lack of transparent procedures makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to assess the quality of the findings presented or to put those findings in context. In this light, it is noteworthy that criteria for a good review paper are rarely spelled out by peer-reviewed journals or included in instructions on scientific writing. The dramatic increase in publications is a challenge for the entire research community, particularly for research fields that are expected to provide policy-relevant data. We argue that only when peer-reviewed journals start specifying quality criteria for review papers, can such papers be relied upon to provide adequate and strategic guidance on the development of CEC research. We anticipate that our findings and conclusions are valid for many other research fields. © 2019 The Authors",CECs; Contaminants of emerging concern; Critical analysis; ECs; Emerging contaminants; Emerging pollutants; Emerging substances of concern; ESOCs; Quality assessment; Research quality; Review papers,Contamination; Degradation; Effluents; Paper; Quality control; Risk assessment; Search engines; Uncertainty analysis; CECs; Contaminants of emerging concerns; Critical analysis; Emerging contaminant; Emerging pollutants; Emerging substances; ESOCs; Quality assessment; Research quality; Review papers; Publishing; critical analysis; data quality; literature review; pollutant; research; attention; content analysis; effluent; human; human experiment; publication; quality control; review; risk assessment; search engine; spelling; systematic review; uncertainty; Web of Science; writing; literature; medical research; pollutant; publishing; Biomedical Research; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Publishing; Review Literature as Topic,,Environmental Pollutants,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, M.B., Zhou, J.L., Huu Hao, N., Guo, W., Thomaidis, N.S., Xu, J., Progress in the biological and chemical treatment technologies for emerging contaminant removal from wastewater: a critical review (2017) J.

These are inversions obligatorily triggered by certain fixed preverbal constituentsas in Here are some examples or Nor did they know the entitlement criteriasince they are not replaceable in context by a comparable clause with SVX canonical word order because this is grammatically unavailable or conveys a different meaning. On the basis of a statistical analysis, it is argued that the distribution of these constructions in scientific texts is related to the degree of the addressors involvement in the text in question. It is further argued that the different types of obligatory inversions retrieved from the corpus may be seen to serve as discourse markers which convey addressors involvement in scientific writing. It will be shown that some obligatory inversions allow the presence of the addressor to change the addressees focus of interest or attention in the text, while other inversions allow the addressor to stress a particular constituent in the inverted clause, thus emphasising a comparative, restrictive or negative meaning. © 2019, © 2019 Society for Studia Neophilologica.",corpus-based analysis; interpersonal function; Obligatory inversion; scientific writing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baayen, R.H., (2008) Analyzing linguistic data: A practical introduction to statistics using R, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Baker, P., (2009) Contemporary corpus linguistics, , London: Continuum; Biber, D., (1988) Variation across speech and writing, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Biber, D., Johansson, S., Leech, G., Conrad, S., Finegan, E., (1999) Longman grammar of spoken and written English, , London: Longman; Birner, B.J., (1996) The discourse function of inversion in English, , New York: Garland; Bresnan, J., Kanerva, J.M., Locative inversion in Chichewa: A case study of factorization in grammar (1992) Syntax and semantics: Syntax and the lexicon, pp. 53-101. , Stowell T., Wehrli E., (eds), New York: Academic Press, &,.

Despite various efforts by other courses and library resources, as instructors we are often faced with the frustration of student plagiarism and related writing problems. Here, we describe a simple Writing in Your Own Voice intervention designed to help students become more aware of different types of plagiarism and writing problems, avoid those problems, and practice writing in their own voice. In this article, we will introduce the types of plagiarism and writing problems commonly encountered in our molecular biology laboratory course, the intervention, and the results of our study. From the evaluation of 365 student reports, we found the intervention resulted in nearly 50% fewer instances of plagiarism and common writing problems. We also observed significantly fewer instances of severe plagiarism (e.g. several sentences copied from an external source). In addition, we find that the effects last for several weeks after the students complete the intervention assignment. This assignment is particularly easy to implement and can be a very useful tool for teaching students how to write in their own voices. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(5):589598, 2019. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology",lab report; laboratory course; Plagiarism; student scientific writing; writing problems,curriculum; education; human; laboratory; psychology; publishing; science; student; writing; Curriculum; Humans; Laboratories; Plagiarism; Science; Students; Writing,,,,,,"The authors thank Dr. Stanley Lo helping refine the Writing in Your Own Voice assignment and Dr. Emily Grossman for testing the assignment in her class.

It is even harder for those for whom English is a second language (ESL learners). Scholars around the world spend a significant amount of time and resources proofreading their work before submitting it for review or publication. In this paper we present a novel machine learning based application for proper word choice task. Proper word choice is a generalization the lexical substitution (LS) and grammatical error correction (GEC) tasks. We demonstrate and evaluate the usefulness of applying bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) tagger, for this task. While state-of-the-art grammatical error correction uses error-specific classifiers and machine translation methods, we demonstrate an unsupervised method that is based solely on a high quality text corpus and does not require manually annotated data. We use a bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM for learning the proper word choice based on a word's sentential context. We demonstrate and evaluate our application in various settings, including both a domain-specific (scientific), writing task and a general-purpose writing task. We perform both strict machine and human evaluation. We show that our domain-specific and general-purpose models outperform state-of-the-art general context learning. As an additional contribution of this research, we also share our code, pre-trained models, and a new ESL learner test set with the research community. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Grammatical error correction; Language modeling; Lexical substitution; LSTM; Writing support,Computational linguistics; Error correction; Learning systems; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Bidirectional recurrent neural networks; Grammatical errors; Language model; LSTM; Machine translation methods; Research communities; Unsupervised method; Writing support system; Long short-term memory,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abadi, M., Agarwal, A., Barham, P., Brevdo, E., Chen, Z., Citro, C., Corrado, G.S., Zheng, X., Tensorflow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Systems (2015), Software available from tensorflow.org; Aharoni, R., Goldberg, Y., Belinkov, Y., Improving sequence to sequence learning for morphological inflection generation: The biu-mit systems for the sigmorphon 2016 shared task for morphological reinflection (2016) Proceedings of the 14th SIGMORPHON Workshop on Computational Research in Phonetics, Phonology, and Morphology, pp. 41-48. , Association for Computational Linguistics Berlin, Germany; Araque, O., Corcuera-Platas, I., Sanchez-Rada, J.F., Iglesias, C.A., Enhancing deep learning sentiment analysis with ensemble techniques in social applications (2017) Expert Syst.

Majority of the animal infectious diseases such as rinderpest and anthrax that used to frequently strike the historic Persia are now gone for good or under control owing to the pioneering researches conducted at the institute in the early-mid 20th century in the field of vaccine manufacturing. The earliest such scientific contributions, were truly made by the French eminent veterinarian Dr. Louis Pierre Joseph Delpy who joined the institute in 1931. In his 18 year-long directorship tenure he taught his colleagues fundamentals of vaccinology, basics of modern epidemiology, essentials of infectious disease control disciplines, the art of scientific writing and much more things that changed the institute for ever. This paper reviews the events and turning points in the first 25 years of service of the institute in a chronological way and remarks Delpys principle involvements in all of these on the occasion of the 120 anniversary of his birth. At the entrance of the institute headquarter building where his bronze bust is placed, visitors can see a memorial etched plate that reads  The architect of Razi and founder of Archives De LInstitute Razi (Archives of Razi Institute) was an enthusiastic scientist with a creative mind.  For the Razi community, Dr Delpy is gone but not forgotten.. © 2019 Urmia University.

We sought to establish the prevalence of statistical themes in the statistical reviews, consideration of contemporary statistical methods, and their associations with time to journal receipt of authors' revision. Methods An initial set of statistical themes was created using the statistical editor's notes. For example, for the statistical theme of ""CONSORT checklist,"" the search term needed was ""CONSORT."" A complete (exhaustive) list of additional themes was obtained inductively. Results Among the 273 subsequent reviews for manuscripts that were ultimately accepted, the number of paragraphs that included a theme of a statistical method was only weakly associated with longer revision times (Kendall ? = 0.139 ± 0.039, P = 0.0004). Among the total 3274 paragraphs of statistical reviews, 72.2% did not include a theme of a statistical method (e.g., the editor instead asked the authors to clarify what statistical method had been used) (95% confidence interval [CI] = 70.6%-73.7%, P < 0.0001 versus 50%). Among the 207 manuscripts with a review that included a statistical method, 47.3% included a contemporary topic (e.g., generalized pivotal methods) (95% CI = 40.4%-54.4%). However, among the 911 corresponding paragraphs of statistical review comments, only 16.0% included a contemporary theme (95% CI = 13.7%-18.6%). Conclusions The revised versions of patient safety articles, which are eventually to be accepted for publication, have many statistical limitations especially in the reporting (writing) of basic statistical methods and results. The results suggest a need for education of patient safety investigators to include statistical writing. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In this context, scientific writing increasingly plays an important role in scholars' scientific careers. To understand the relationship between scientific writing and scientific impact, this paper selected 12 variables of linguistic complexity as a proxy for depicting scientific writing. We then analyzed these features from 36,400 full-text Biology articles and 1,797 full-text Psychology articles. These features were compared to the scientific impact of articles, grouped into high, medium, and low categories. The results suggested no practical significant relationship between linguistic complexity and citation strata in either discipline. This suggests that textual complexity plays little role in scientific impact in our data sets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.",English scientific writing; Lexical complexity; Lexical density; Lexical diversity; Lexical sophistication; Syntactic complexity,Employment; Technical writing; Lexical complexity; Lexical diversity; Lexical sophistication; Scientific writing; Syntactic complexity; Linguistics,,,,,"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing

This study treats scientific writing as a social practice, taking as its premise the notion that participating in related activities such as reading, peer evaluation, and discussion would positively affect the competence of students scientific writing, by developing their epistemic cognition regarding scientific knowledge communication and legitimation. An empirical study was conducted with twenty-two Chinese undergraduate students to test this premise. These students were majoring in chemistry and undertook a researcher-designed intervention course (Advanced Organic Chemistry Experiment), which embodied the integrated strategy of reading, peer evaluation, and discussion on scientific writing. Based on data pertaining to those students performance in terms of the normativity, objectivity, and logicality of scientific writing drawn from a previous study by the current author (Deng, Kelly, & Xiao, 2019. The development of Chinese undergraduate students competence of scientific writing in the context of advanced organic chemistry experiment course. Chemistry Education Research and Practice, 20, 270287), alongside data drawn from students written texts in reading reflections and on-line discourse related to peer evaluation and discussion, this study claimed that the tasks of reading, peer evaluation, and discussion were seen gradually to lead to the development of Chinese undergraduate students greater competence in scientific writing regarding the synthetic experiments of organic chemistry. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",discussion; peer evaluation; reading; Scientific writing,,,,,,"Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE: CCNU19TD006, CCNU19QN067, 17YJC880016","We would like to acknowledge the support of the MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Youth Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (17YJC880016) and the Financially Supported by Self-Determined Research Funds of CCNU from the Colleges?

Human beings have been able to communicate for thousands of years. Yet scientific communication as it is today is relatively new. It was only 300 years ago that the first journals were published. Writing is the most vital means for communicating scientific work. It helps document and communicate ideas, activities and findings to others. Good writing can be beneficial to scientists in a number of ways. In this article we have discussed the basic overview and principles of scientific writing. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

A well-written discussion should provide clear statements of the main findings, possible explanations and implications, strengths and weaknesses of the study and other studies, unanswered questions, and suggestions for future research. The authors also need to clarify the external validity of the findings and show how the findings can be generalized. In this review, we focus on the function, content, and organization of the discussion section of a hypothesis-testing paper. Beyond providing the most important principles and common strategies for organizing the discussion section, we also discuss metadiscourse, scientific explanation (reasoning and contextualization), and models of scientific explanation.

Laboratory instructors often use similarity-matching software to detect plagiarism in laboratory reports, yet similarity hits detected with such software remain poorly characterized. In the upper division molecular biology laboratory course described here, Turnitin® routinely detected dozens of similarity hits in laboratory reports. To determine whether this abundance of similarity hits was indicative of widespread plagiarism, we analyzed similarity hits detected in 255 laboratory reports written by 135 students. Only a small minority of Turnitin® similarity matches were problematic, but over half of the laboratory reports contained at least one problem with incorporation of scientific sources (e.g., laboratory manual and scientific articles). We identified four common types of such writing problems: patchwriting, technical parroting, copying, and falsification of sources. In 18% of the laboratory reports, we detected an alarmingly superficial use of primary literature. Most of the source incorporation problems did not rise to the level of plagiarism. As a result of this study, we recommend changes in scientific writing instruction and a transition to laboratories providing more authentic research experiences. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(4):370379, 2019. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology",laboratory reports; Plagiarism; similarity-matching software; source incorporation; undergraduate laboratory courses,biology; education; human; laboratory; publishing; software; student; writing; Biology; Humans; Laboratories; Plagiarism; Software; Students; Writing,,,,,120621XX,"This study was determined to be exempt from IRB approval by the UC San Diego Human Research Protections Program, project #120621XX.",,,,,,,"Carter, M., Ways of knowing, doing, and writing in the disciplines (2007) Coll.

This article argues that this focus on light has rather led to neglect of the role played by the (gem)stones which interact with this light to represent a core component of the plot. It reads the interplay between geological entities and light as mirroring the interplay between materiality and immateriality to offer a fresh interpretation of key points in the tale. Drawing on Goethe?s scientific work in the fields of colour theory and geology, this article situates the ?Märchen? within his wider oeuvre and fleshes out parallels (and points of difference) in the representation of (im)materiality across Goethe?s writings. Focusing on questions of wholeness and fragmentation, the article closes with a call for a greater sense of fluidity in the approach to Goethe?s literary and scientific writings, choosing to see them as placed on a continuum rather than as belonging to distinctly separate genres. © 2019 The Author German Life and Letters and 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Caisley, J.; University of CambridgeUnited Kingdom",,,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,,,,,168777,,,,English,Ger.

The practice presents a complex set of ethical and practical challenges to the scientific community, many of which have not been addressed in prior discourse on the subject. This essay identifies and discusses these factors in a systematic fashion, concluding with a new definition of text recycling that takes these factors into account. Topics include terminology, what is not text recycling, factors affecting judgements about the appropriateness of text recycling, and visual materials. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Engineering writing; Plagiarism; Scientific writing; Self-plagiarism; Text recycling; Textual recycling,article; decision making; human; human experiment; nomenclature; publishing; recycling; writing,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aad, G., ATLAS collaboration, CMS collaboration (2015) Physical Review Letters, 114, p. 191803; (2014) Re-Using Text from a Grant Proposal in a Paper (Or Vice Versa), , https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/24009/re-using-text-from-a-grant-proposal-in-a-paper-or-viceversa, June 24, Academic Stack Exchange, Retrieved 10 Feb 2017; Is submitting papers based on classwork papers self-plagiarism?

Thus, for the past four years we have been developing and running a course in scientific writing and oral presentation in English at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), one of the premier institutions of higher education in China. For the first years, the course was offered to a highly select group of primarily biomedical engineering, mostly PhD, graduate students, the field in which the two principals of the course - one Chinese professor and one U.S. professor - hold their academic appointments. In the most recent offering of the course, the student population was expanded greatly to include almost 200 MS and PhD students from many of the Schools at SJTU. In this 2018 offering a large faculty team was established to provide tutorials to groups of roughly 12 students to supplement the lecture component delivered by the U.S. professor. Student and faculty reviews of the course have been mostly positive and many important lessons have been learnt through the experience. The most critical of these lessons are being incorporated into a revised plan for the course when it is offered next in 2019. It is felt that our experience should be of interest to others contemplating the challenges of preparing nonnative English speakers for the engineering profession in this twenty-first century. In the paper we share our methodology of teaching and detail the major challenges faced in this project. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019",,,,,,,"North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO

Stress is an organism's reaction to unpleasant (stimulation), stress must be understood as an interactive relationship that occurs between physical, physiological, psychological and behavioral systems. Factors suspected to affect stress are biological, psychological and socio-cultural factors. This study aims to determine the relationship of interpersonal communication of students in the manufacture of scientific papers against stress. The type of research used is the type of quantitative research with correlational research design and through a cross sectional approach. The sample of this research is 55 students who are conducting scientific writing papers in Akper 17 Karanganyar, which has fulfilled the criteria of inclusion and exclusion selected in total sampling.

Researchers have been searching for new instructional models to engage students variety of scientific practices to fulfil the requirements of scientific literacy. Argument Driven Inquiry (ADI) is a novel instructional model that integrates the practices of argumentation and inquiry. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of ADI to preservice science teachers metacognitive awareness and scientific writing skills. For this purpose single group pre-posttest design was conducted with 50 pre-service science teachers. It was found that ADI helped to improve pre-service science teachers meta-cognitive awareness and writing skills. There are some conclusions and implications of the study for researchers and teachers dealing with scientific literacy and laboratory applications in the current study. © 2019, International Journal of Research in Education and Science.

However, as publication rates increase, so does the amount of detected plagiarism, including self-plagiarism. This concept, also referred to as text recycling, is defined as the repurposing of one's own previously published work in new publications without referencing the original source. There are advocates both for and against versions of text recycling, but without a universal protocol for authors and editors of what constitutes self-plagiarism, there is no strict standard among journals as to what is unethical. The advent of online text duplication detection software has been increasingly used by journals to assure that all published work is novel, but challenges remain. Converging on standardized guidelines would be beneficial with regard to text recycling and improving author education and the promotion of active communication between journals and authors during the submission process if confusion arises. © 2018 The Author(s)",plagiarism; Text recycling,article; editor; education; human; human experiment; practice guideline; publishing; recycling; software; writing,,,,,,,,,,,,,"American Psychological Association, Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (2010), 6th ed.

To uncover the differences in English scientific writing between native English-speaking scholars (NESs) and NNESs, we collected a large-scale data set containing more than 150,000 full-text articles published in PLoS between 2006 and 2015. We divided these articles into three groups according to the ethnic backgrounds of the first and corresponding authors, obtained by Ethnea, and examined the scientific writing styles in English from a two-fold perspective of linguistic complexity: (a) syntactic complexity, including measurements of sentence length and sentence complexity; and (b) lexical complexity, including measurements of lexical diversity, lexical density, and lexical sophistication. The observations suggest marginal differences between groups in syntactical and lexical complexity. © 2018 ASIS&T",,Linguistics; High impact; Large scale data sets; Linguistic complexity; Measurements of; Non-native; Scientific writing; Sentence length; Syntactic complexity; Technical writing; article; human; human experiment; publishing; speech; writing,,,,,"China Scholarship Council, CSC: 201606840093

Students who have higher order thinking skills will be have the ability of connect different concepts, interpret, problem solving, communication, reasoning, and make the right decisions. Identification of higher order thinking skills needs to be done through research and the results are expected to be used as a reference to design of instructional strategies that are appropriate to the characteristics of students. In this study, identification is done by measuring the ability of problem solving, communication, and reasoning skills. The results showed that students' ability to solve of well structured problem including satisfactory but the ability to solve of ill structured problem needs to be developed. For communication skill, students are still not used to expressing their ideas in scientific writing.

The availability of state-of-the-art modeling software provides an opportunity to achieve this goal in interesting ways. The Protein Structure and Function Exploration (PSAFE) project was developed at the University of Virginia to introduce undergraduate biochemists to the significance of structure-function relationships and the nuances of scientific writing. The PSAFE project uses the molecular-document capability of the ICM Browser (from Molsoft LLC) to accomplish its goals. Students in introductory biochemistry lecture courses are each assigned a particular protein or nucleic acid to study and characterize throughout the semester. The students progress from learning the basics of protein structure early in the course to a thorough analysis of their proteins and how they achieve their functions, culminating in production of a descriptive narrative by the end of the semester. The student projects are reviewed and edited and then uploaded to an archival website. More than 1100 such projects have now been archived on this site. The majority of the students in these courses report that the PSAFE project was a challenging but highly satisfying experience that greatly enriched their understanding and appreciation of protein structure. PSAFE Online is now available to any interested instructors and students. © 2019 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.",Biochemistry; Computer-Based Learning; Hands-On Learning/Manipulatives; Molecular Modeling; Nucleic Acids/DNA/RNA; Proteins/Peptides; Upper-Division Undergraduate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wolfson, A.J., Hall, M.L., Branham, T.R., An integrated biochemistry laboratory, including molecular modeling (1996) J.

Paradoxically, surprise is cognitive in nature and recognized as a knowledge emotion. Given the connection between surprise and knowledge-making, it is surprising that linguistic expressions of surprise (i.e., surprise markers) in academic discourse have received little research attention. This article reports on an empirical study of surprise markers in research articles. Informed by Charles Fillmore's frame semantics, the study identified and analyzed all the surprise markers in a corpus of 320 research articles. A total of 439 surprise markers were found to evoke seven interconnected semantic frames. These semantic frames contained eight conceptually distinct frame elements, five of which were markedly more frequent than the rest and appeared in 12.76100% of the frame instances identified. Based on the results of the analyses, a genre-specific Surprise frame with five key frame elements was generalized and is presented in this article as a conceptual tool for understanding how surprise and its linguistic expressions partake in the construction of scientific knowledge. Recommendations are made about how the conceptual frame can inform future research. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Frame semantics; Knowledge emotion; Research article; Surprise marker; The emotion of surprise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abdi, R., Interpersonal metadiscourse: an indicator of interaction and identity (2002) Discourse Stud., 4, pp. 139-145; Caffi, C., Janney, R.W., Toward a pragmatics of emotive communication (1994) J.
